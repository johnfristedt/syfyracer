PDG SpaceSkyBox
---------------

Thank you for purchasing this asset and supporting future projects and updates!


Overview:

You should have received 30 materials (Skyboxes) to play with.

To deactivate the particle-fx, just go: Hierarchy->Main Camera->Particle System and delete it.
The particle system will not be attached to the camera any more.

If you like to, you can just go to the SSB->Prefabs folder and drag "Particle System" over to your 
Main Camera in the Hierarchy View. 

To change a skybox, just go Edit->Render Settings->and choose a “Skybox Material”
(All materials named “SkyBox” are what their names indicate – skyboxes)

Remember to adjust the overall lighting (Edit->Render Settings) to fit the mood of a chosen skybox. 
A scene may not look right, when changing a skybox but not adjusting the lighting accordingly!

To adjust the position of the light source (Sun) and the flare I have added a little helper.
Just rotate the scene-view until a bright star or sun is centred in the middle of the viewport.
Then go to "Hierarchy" and select "Directional light (SUN)". After that go to Menu-Bar "Helpers" and select
"SetLightDirection" - you´re done! From now, the light/flare will emerge from that direction in the skybox
, where you centred the view before.

Why there are up to 3 versions of a map?

This is simple: I want you to have as much freedom to design your own "space" as you may need.

Behind the scenes of this asset:

Name conventions

Color1_(Color2)_(Color3)_Nebula_(Stars)_(Sun)		(....) = optional


Examples: 

There are of course millions of colors, but these images mainly consist from 2-3 different colored nebulas

BG_NSS = Blue/Green with Nebula, Stars and Sun
BG_NS = Blue/Green with Nebula, Stars (no Sun)
BG_N = Blue/Green only Nebula

The .PNG files in "BG_NSS" are named "BGNSS_(Res)_(pos).png" 

pos= internal marker for mapping to the skybox-renderer

So "BGNSS_2048_front5.png" would be 1of6 images from a blue/green (BG) "space-skybox", with Nebulas, Stars and a Sun (NSS)
and will be displayed on what it the front-face of the rendered skybox.

In other words: The "NSS-Materials" got a "complete" universe with a Nebula(s), Stars and a Sun.

But if you don’t want a "Sun" in your Skybox because you want to make your own particle-driven-one
or create something else to act as a sun - then you likely don’t want a skybox, with a "2nd sun", right?

In that case, the so called "NS-maps" are the way to go.


"N-maps"

Let’s assume, you would like to have a particle or sprite or whatnot driven star field. For that reason you maybe want
a background with no additional stars on it, because otherwise it would be "too full of stars", then ;)


I took all this into account and try to provide you with the "just right" skyboxes - i hope you enjoy them!
